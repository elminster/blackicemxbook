## Learning Verilog

### Books

Simon Monk's book : [Programming FPGAs: Getting Started with Verilog](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-FPGAs-Getting-Started-Verilog-ebook/dp/B01M0F1L5G) is good for beginners and explains how to program in Verilog and drive simple hardware.

Its examples are for commercial FPGAs, so need some conversion to run on Blackice Mx.

Steven Hugg's book [Designing Video Game Hardware in Verilog](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Video-Game-Hardware-Verilog-ebook/dp/B07LD48CTV) is good if you are interested in retro computing. 

It has an [interesting companion web site](https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.4.2/?platform=verilog) with an online editor and simulator for Verilog.

### Web sites

The [fpga4fun](https://www.fpga4fun.com/) web site is very good, and the source of some of the examples in this ebook.

The [fpga4student](https://fpga4student.com) also has some interesting projects.

The [FPGA Wars](https://github.com/Obijuan/open-fpga-verilog-tutorial/wiki/Home_EN) commiunity have a Verilog tutorial.

### Online courses

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/fpga/) has some FPGA and Verilog courses.

## Risc V cores

There is a list of [RISC-V cores and SoC platforms](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cores-list) on github, but it is not complete.

Some of the RISC-V cores that run on ice40 devices include:

[picorv32](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32/tree/master/picosoc)

[icicle](https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/icicle)

[Vexriscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv)

## SoC generators

## Verilog 

PicoSoc

icoSoC

BlackSoc

icicle

FuseSoC

## SpinalHDL

Murax

Briey

SaxonSoc

### migen

LiteX

## Other Hardware Description Languages

[SpinalHDL](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL) is the language that VexRiscv and SaxonSoc is written in. Its author is Charles Papn (Dolu1990). There is [online documentation](https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/).
